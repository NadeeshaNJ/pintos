			   ARGUMENT PASSING
			   ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

No new structs added. Only used local variables and existing `struct thread`.  
Used `char *argv[]` for pushing arguments onto the stack in correct order.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

I used `strtok_r()` to split the command into program name and arguments.  
Arguments were pushed in reverse order to keep argv[] aligned.  
Used word alignment to avoid stack overflow.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

`strtok_r()` is reentrant, which avoids shared state issues during context switches.  
`strtok()` would break if multiple processes use it at once.

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

Unix shells handle argument separation, which is cleaner and more flexible.  
It lets users combine commands and redirections easily.  
Also keeps kernel-side logic simpler.

			     SYSTEM CALLS
			     ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

Added a global `struct lock filesys_lock` for file system synchronization.  
Each process keeps a simple file table:

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

Each process has its own file table.  
File descriptors are unique only within a process, not system-wide.  
`fd 0` and `fd 1` are reserved for input/output.



---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

For user data read/write, I used a helper `validate_ptr()` to check if the pointer is valid  
and below `PHYS_BASE`. If valid, I read directly; else, the process exits.  
If a bad pointer still caused a page fault, `page_fault()` handled it safely.


>> B4: Suppose a system call causes a full page (4,096 bytes) of data
>> to be copied from user space into the kernel.  What is the least
>> and the greatest possible number of inspections of the page table
>> (e.g. calls to pagedir_get_page()) that might result?  What about
>> for a system call that only copies 2 bytes of data?  Is there room
>> for improvement in these numbers, and how much?

If a full page (4096 bytes) is copied, the table might be checked once or twice (beginning and end).  
For 2 bytes, usually one lookup is enough.  
Maybe batching reads could reduce lookups, but Pintos is small-scale, so I left it simple.


>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

For `wait`, I used a `child_status` struct that stores exit codes and semaphores.  
Parent waits using a semaphore until the child exits, then reads the exit code and frees memory.


>> B6: Any access to user program memory at a user-specified address

>> accesses, e.g. a "write" system call requires reading the system

>> paragraphs, describe the strategy or strategies you adopted for
>> managing these issues.  Give an example.

To keep things simple, I validated all user pointers first.  
If one fails, I exit early and release any locks.  
This avoids deep nested error handling.  
I used `try-finalize` style cleanup inside the syscall functions to make it readable.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

Used semaphores for both loading and waiting. 

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

Each child has a `child_status` in the parent’s list. 

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

I used direct pointer validation because it’s simple to debug.  

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

Using plain `struct file *` arrays is lightweight and fits Pintos’ scale.  
Not flexible for advanced features but easy to maintain.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

Kept TID and PID the same (identity mapping).  

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
